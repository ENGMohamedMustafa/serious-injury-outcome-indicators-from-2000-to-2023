Content: This dataset contains serious injury outcome indicators from 2000 to 2023, focusing on various causes of injuries, including assaults and falls.
Metrics: The data includes metrics such as the number of injuries, confidence intervals, and age-standardized rates per 100,000 people.
Potential Issues
Missing Values: Certain entries may have missing data, which can affect the accuracy of analyses and predictions.
Data Reliability: The dataset relies on reported incidents, which may lead to underreporting or overreporting of injuries, impacting the overall validity of the findings.
Time Period Limitations: The dataset spans over two decades, which may not capture recent trends or changes in injury patterns.
Categorical Encoding: The classification of injury types and severity may require careful consideration to avoid misinterpretation.
# Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For static and advanced data visualizations.
Plotly: For creating interactive plots.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and metrics.
# Steps in Analysis
Data Loading: The notebook loads a CSV file containing serious injury outcome indicators.
Data Exploration: Displays the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and checks for missing values to ensure data integrity.
Data Preprocessing: Involves dropping missing values and encoding categorical variables.
# Modeling:
Purpose: The modeling phase aims to build predictive models that can forecast future injury outcomes based on historical data.
Techniques: Various machine learning algorithms may be employed, such as:
Linear Regression: For predicting continuous outcomes.
Decision Trees: For capturing non-linear relationships.
Random Forest: For improving prediction accuracy through ensemble learning.
Support Vector Regression: For handling high-dimensional data.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score to assess their performance.
# Visualization:
Purpose: Visualization is a crucial step in data analysis, helping to communicate findings effectively.
Techniques: Different visualization techniques can be used:
Bar Charts: To compare the number of injuries across different causes.
Line Graphs: To show trends over time.
Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between variables.
Interactive Dashboards: Using Plotly for real-time data exploration.
Deployment:
Purpose: The deployment phase involves making the predictive model accessible for end-users or stakeholders
